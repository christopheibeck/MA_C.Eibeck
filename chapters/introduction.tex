\chapter{Introduction}
This is the introductory chapter.
It is usually a page or two.
Tell a story about the objectives, explain them briefly and outline the structure of your thesis.

\section{Structuring your thesis}

An example structure would be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction
\item Theoretical basis
\item Your work
\item Measurement results
\item Conclusion
\end{enumerate}

This is just an example, choose a structure that fits the nature of your work.

\section{References}
Citing references is always good. Plagiarizing, however, is strictly forbidden!

\section{Images}
If possible use vector graphics. Only use pixel graphics for photos. TikZ is also an interesting option for creating all sorts of images.

And don't forget \SI{10.0815}{\giga\byte} of data is quite a lot.
This is an example how to use the siunitx package.
